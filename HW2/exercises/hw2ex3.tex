\section*{Exercise 3.}

Program the steepest descent and Newton algorithms using the backtracking line search, Algorithm 3.1. Use them to minimize the Rosenbrock function (2.22). Set the initial step length $\alpha = 1$ and print the step length used by each method at each iteration. First try the initial point $x_0 = (1.2,1.2)^T$ and then the more difficult starting point $x_0 = (-1.2, 1)^T$.
