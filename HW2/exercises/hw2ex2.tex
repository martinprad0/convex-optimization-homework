\section*{Exercise 2.}

Consider the function $f(x,y) = x^2 + \alpha xy^2 + 2 y^4$. Show that all the parameter values except two, the origin $(0,0)$ is the only critical point of $f$.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*]
    \item Find the exceptional $\alpha$'s and show that $f$ has infinitely many critical points for these $\alpha$ values. Determine the nature of these critical points.
    \item Consider the values of $\alpha$'s for which the origin is the only critical point. For each $\alpha$, determine the nature of the critical point. Show that in some cases, the origin is a local minimum, but in other cases, it is a saddle point.
    \item Show that even when the origin is a saddle point, (0,0) is a local strict minimizer of $f$ on every line passing through the origin. In fact, show that, except for one line, the function $g(t) := f(td)$ satisfies $g'(0) = 0$ and $g''(0) > 0$.
