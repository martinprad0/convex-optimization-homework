\section*{Exercise 5.}

A subset $S\subset \N$ is in \textit{arithmetic progression} if there exists $a,d\in\N$ such that
\[ S = \{a+nd \;:\; n\in\N_0\}. \]
The number $d$ is called the difference of the progression. Prove that $\N$ cannot be partitioned in a finite number greater than 1 of arithmetic progressions with different differences.
